## Technologies
### Docker
A tool offering a virtualised environment for running applications independent of underlying operating system level. Applications run in self-contained environments called **containers** and can be easily transferrable/deployable.

We will use Docker for microservices deployment and local development.

### Docker Compose

An extension of Docker, allowing us to deploy multi-container applications via a single config file and with a single command. Allows for easy and atomic services spawn/de-spawn, and generally saves a lot of time.
